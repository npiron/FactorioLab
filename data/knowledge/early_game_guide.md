## Phase 1: The Very First Moments (0-10 minutes)

### Critical Resources
You MUST have these four solid resources near spawn:
1. **Iron Ore** (blue-gray rocks)
2. **Copper Ore** (orange rocks)
3. **Coal** (black rocks)
4. **Stone** (beige rocks)

Also need **Water** nearby for Steam Engines.

### First Actions
1. **Mine large rocks first** - They give coal AND stone, fastest early resource
2. Place your starting **Burner Mining Drill** on iron, facing a **Stone Furnace**
3. Put coal in BOTH the drill and furnace as fuel
4. Manually mine coal while waiting for iron plates

### Bootstrap Mining Setup
```
Coal Patch: 2 drills facing each other → self-fueling infinite coal
Stone Patch: 1 drill → output to chest
Iron Patch: 4-8 drill+furnace pairs
Copper Patch: 1-3 drill+furnace pairs (less needed early)
```

**Important Ratio**: You need ~2x as much iron as copper early game.

---

## Phase 2: Basic Automation (10-20 minutes)

### Belt + Inserter Revolution
Once you have ~20 iron plates:
1. Craft **Transport Belts** and **Burner Inserters**
2. Run a coal belt to your furnaces
3. Use inserters to auto-feed coal into furnaces

**Inserter Tip**: Burner inserters can fuel themselves from coal belts!

### What to Build
- 4+ furnaces on iron
- 2+ furnaces on copper
- Plenty of coal drills (2 facing each other = infinite fuel)
- Stone drill → chest (for furnaces later)

---

## Phase 3: Steam Power (20-30 minutes)

### Components Needed
- 1 Offshore Pump (place in water)
- 1 Boiler
- 2 Steam Engines
- 10-20 Pipes
- Small Electric Poles

### Setup
```
[Water] → Offshore Pump → Boiler → 2x Steam Engine → Power Poles → Labs
```

**Critical**: Connect boiler on SHORT side (water in). Connect steam engine on SHORT side (steam in).

### Power Expansion Ratio
- 1 Offshore Pump = 20 Boilers = 40 Steam Engines
- 1 Boiler = 2 Steam Engines EXACTLY

---

## Phase 4: First Research (30-45 minutes)

### Priority Research Order
1. **Automation** (unlocks Assembling Machine 1)
2. **Logistics** (unlocks Underground Belts, Splitters, Fast Inserter)
3. **Military** → **Turrets** (for Biter defense)
4. **Electronics** → **Fast Inserter**
5. **Logistic Science Pack** (green science)

### Red Science Automation
```
Materials needed:
- 3 Assembling Machines
- 7 Inserters
- 2 Iron Chests

Setup:
[Iron Chest] → Assembler (Iron Gear) → Belt → Assembler (Red Science) → Labs
[Copper Chest] → direct to Science Assembler
```

---

## Phase 5: Electric Era (45-60 minutes)

### Upgrade Path
1. Replace Burner Mining Drills with **Electric Mining Drills**
2. Place Electric drills on coal FIRST (to power your boilers)
3. Build proper smelting lines

### Smelting Module (for 1 full yellow belt)
- **48 Stone Furnaces** to fill 1 yellow belt
- **48 Fast Inserters** (input)
- **48 Long-Handed Inserters** (output)
- 2 belt inputs: Ore + Coal

### Mining Layout
- 30 Electric Mining Drills = 1 full yellow belt of ore
- Max 15 drills per side of belt
- Use underground belts to hop over power poles

---

## Phase 6: Defense

### Biter Behavior
- Alien nests convert pollution into bugs
- Bugs attack things that generate pollution
- Military structures are priority targets

### Defense Tips
- Biters hit 2 squares away → put turrets behind 1 wall with 1-square gap
- Spitters shoot over walls but pause before firing
- 10 Turrets minimum for starting defense
- Keep ammo production automated:
  ```
  Iron Chest → 2 Assemblers (Ammo) → Output Chest
  ```

---

## Next Steps: Main Bus (60+ minutes)

### Main Bus Contents
- 2-4 belts of Iron Plates
- 2-4 belts of Copper Plates
- 1-2 belts of Green Circuits
- 1 belt of Steel
- 1 belt of Coal
- 1 belt of Stone/Brick

### Key Milestones
1. Full belt of Iron Plates (first priority)
2. Full belt of Copper Plates
3. Green Science automation
4. First Car (massive mobility boost)
5. Outpost expansion

## Quick Reference Numbers

| Item | Count to Fill Yellow Belt |
|------|---------------------------|
| Stone Furnaces (iron/copper) | 47 |
| Steel/Electric Furnaces | 24 |
| Electric Mining Drills | 30 |
| Burner Mining Drills | 48 |

| Ratio | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Boiler : Steam Engine | 1:2 |
| Offshore Pump : Boilers | 1:20 |
| Copper Cable : Green Circuit Assemblers | 3:2 |
| Science Golden Ratio | 5 Red : 6 Green : 12 Blue : 2 Purple |

## Critical Tips

1. **Never hand-craft** what you can automate
2. **Iron is king** - you always need more iron than anything else
3. **Coal feeding** - automate coal delivery ASAP
4. **Leave room** - space out your factory for future expansion
5. **Research Automation first** - unlocks the Assembling Machine which changes everything
